== Accrued Interest
In accounting, *accrued interest* refers to the amount of interest that has been incurred, as of a specific date, on a loan or other financial obligation but has not yet been paid out.

Accrued interest can either be in the form of accrued interest revenue, for the lender, or accrued interest expense, for the borrower.

The term accrued interest can also refer to the amount of bond interest that has accumulated since the last time a bond interest payment was made.
