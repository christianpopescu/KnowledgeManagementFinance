=== Trade Affirmation

When one party claims the contents of an SB swap contract to its counterparty, and the counterparty confirms the information if they are correct, this is known as trade affirmation. The trade affirmation process involves completing a trade, after which the counterparties check and validate the specifics before submitting it for settlement.

*Trade affirmation* is the process through which trade details are verified and agreed between the direct and indirect participants to a trade, for example, between an institution that has traded on behalf of a client and the client itself (the institution is the direct participant while the client is the indirect participant).
